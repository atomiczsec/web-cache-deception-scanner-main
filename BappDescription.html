  <b>About Web Cache Deception</b>
</p>

<p>
  Web Cache Deception is a critical vulnerability first described by security researcher Omer Gil in 2017. It exploits misconfigurations in web caching systems, allowing attackers to trick caches into storing and serving sensitive, user-specific content as if it were public static resources. This can lead to the exposure of private data, authentication tokens, or other confidential information to unauthorized users.<br>

<ul>
  <li>
    The attacker crafts a URL that appends a fake static file extension (e.g., <code>/profile/secret.jpg</code>) to a sensitive endpoint.
  </li>
  <li>
    The victim, while authenticated, visits this URL, causing the cache to store the sensitive content under the deceptive path.
  </li>
  <li>
    The attacker then accesses the same URL and receives the cached sensitive data.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>Impact</b>: Successful exploitation can result in theft of personal information, authentication tokens, CSRF tokens, account data, or even enable further attacks such as Cross-Site Request Forgery or account takeover.<br>

</p>

<p>
  <b>Mitigation</b>: Ensure cache servers respect application <code>Cache-Control</code> headers, and avoid caching decisions based solely on URL patterns or file extensions. Sensitive resources should never be cached as public content.
